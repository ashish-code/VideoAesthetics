# VideoAesthetics
Project [under development] on analysis of aesthetics in videos. 
Analysis of aesthetics in images has been a topic of research for several years. 
We cast the problem of video aesthetics as an aggregate description of aesthetics in perceptual key-frames of a video.

Currently the project has several python files for webscraping meta-data on video clips from the internet; downloading the videos;
extracting low-level descriptors for the video towards building a aesthetics filter for videos.
